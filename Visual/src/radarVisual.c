/*******************************************************************************
 *
 *  To Do List
 *  ==========
 * ToDo: Reduce screen updating for Ciaran, too much data on screen.
 * 
 * BUGS in Git!!!!
 * 
 * 31   Add in way of knowing it is running or not, a coloured circle maybe.
 * 30   Is it worth changing the Set for gain to set for all Config...
 *          Would need to change the text on screen a little and maybe set it 
 *          to active or greyed out.
 *          Either way the screen needs to be clearer
 * 32   Does the Sample and Hold signal need to be set to run for all modes, includes ADC?
 * 25   Check the gpio pin connections & re-write them to reflect the new hardware
 *      IF_OUT_DIGITAL - Used for frequency counting - it's the raw signal digitised, GPIO 4
 *              No gain control on this pin.
 *      IF_OUT_PGA - Digital output, but amplified
 *      IF_OUT_TO_PI - for movement detection, post gain control
 *
 * 26   Check the filter code to use, high or notches
 *          Take this out for the Pi. Is there an alternative out there?
 * 27   On linkedLists, add a maximum number of readings to store & when exceeded, remove the tail. **URGENT
 *  DONE    2   Create a single H file for all the common stuff
 *  DONE            a What is the right way of doing this, is there a structure or a method for this?
 *  DONE            b What should I do about the various return status'
 *                  Should these be different value ranges
 *  CM 22  Updated linked lists to add a delete function
 *  24  Change gainFunctions to use typedef struct ...
 *          See the gainfunctions.h file
 *          i Split gainFunctions into user functions and internal functions
 *  7   Integrate LEDs into common library
 *          Not required at this time, integrate into the application instead.
 *  9   Code tidy up
 *          a Update comments and check they are correct
 *          b Update function descriptions in h files to ensure they are correct
 *              LEDControl
 *          c Remove redundant code
 *  13  Write instructions on how to compile into application
 *  15  Write some instructions on how to use the application
 *  16  Add tick marks to the scale for gain setting
 *  18  When starting up, set the value of the mode to unknown and not the first radiobutton
 *  20  Add scale and associated code to set the reading speed
 *  21  On run timer trigger when capturing values (running = true)
 *  4   Convert SPi to use ioctl as this doesn't require elevated privileges
 *  28  Change the GUI to give control over refresh time and data collection time
 * 
 *      
 *  DONE    8   Make Gain control structure contain required allowable values and use these in scale
 *  DONE    3   On GUI remove the bits at the bottom as they are not needed
 *  DONE    1   Get gain setting to only allow values available from the device
 *  DONE    16  Link the Mode Info at the bottom to the mode selected
 *  DONE    17  Link the Gain Setting at the bottom of the screen to the gain selected
 *  FIXED    BUG: There is something wrong with the graphing / linked list as the values don't match. When I have multiple data values
 *      in the linked list, the quantity graphed DON'T include the ones that were captured before switching to graph mode
 *      Could it be to do with the LinkedList within the structure NOT being a pointer.
 *      It would appear that the first value captured in the data timer is then not printed on the graph. I would guess it
 *      could be something to do with how I initialise the nodes within linkedlist.
  * DONE 10  Implement the smoothing algorithm in the common code
 *          see filter.c and filter.h
 *          The code is very short, but it takes quite a lot of processing power to run!
 *              Itâ€™s probably clear to you, but just pass each measured level to the relevant 
 *              filter and after the appropriate delay (until it has enough samples) it will 
 *              return the filtered values. notch_filter_100 will (obviously!) filters out the 
 *              [harmonics] of the 50Hz interference.  The coefficients are dependent on the 
 *              clock frequency, which I believe is 16MHz, so will need adjusting if you use a 
 *              different clock frequency.
 * DONE  5   Both gain and ADC use SPI, but on different lines, so I need to change serial port to spi port
 * DONE         a How do I have different settings for the same port?
 * DONE         b If the gain setting is done within the code and doesn't return the port, it can open and close it
 * DONE         c In the ADC reading, it needs to return the port so it can be used when reading new values
 *  DONE    19  Integrate program with reading of values as required by radiobutton setting
 *  DONE    a Firstly get random value to add in
 *  NOT REQD        a2 Change to using time and value
 *  NOT REQD           It will also need 2 data values, not 1
 *  NOT REQD    Not sure this is needed as values are captured in threads and therefore at a fixed time.
 *  DONE        This may need more linkedList functions / values
 *  DONE            max data value
 *  DONE            min data value
 *  DONE            quantity of readings
 *  DONE    a3 Change to use a scale values
 *  DONE        Need to move translate_example2 into radarVisual to get it drawing lines!
 *  DONE    a4 Change to have fixed max (3V3) and min values (0V)
 *  DONE    b Change to default source
 *  DONE    c Change to required source
 *  DONE        c2 Implement other sources
 *  DONE        Raw
 *  DONE        Filtered - see 10 below
 *  DONE        Frequency via digital
 * DONE 23  Update linked lists to include a counter and a maximum number of values
 * DONE     Counter added
 * DONE     a update structure to have the 2 variables, max reading, min reading
 * DONE 6   Rewrite common to be a better library
 * DONE         a Return success status
 * DONE         gainFunctions
 * DONE         rdr_spi_comms
 * DONE         gpioFunctions
